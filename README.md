## Surge
The challenge of this project was to create a plausible app, in under a week, based on a random lottery of audience-type and API.  My lottery ticket came up with Activists for the audience and the newsAPI for the endpoint.

The concept I came up with is a sort of mash-up of Flipboard and Pinterest: Users can track what topics they care about and get notified of local gatherings for others with similiar interests.

## Project Goals
* Pull in articles from the newsAPI
* Allow users to save articles on issues that they care about
* Allow users to comment on interesting articles
* User can see a list of articles they follow.
* Users can see local meetups with others who follow and share interests in the same issues.
